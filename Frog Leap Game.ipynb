The left set of frogs can only move right, the right set of frogs can only move left.\n","2. Frogs can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from opposite side.\n","3. The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions.\n","\n","\n","## Steps to solve the problem:\n","### Step1:-\n","- Display green and brown frogs on the left and right sides initially.\n","\n","Initial Display :-  \n","```\n","[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]\n","['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']\n","```\n","<br>\n","Here 'G' represents Green frogs on the left side and 'B' represents brown frogs on the right side.

Entered position should be between 0 to 6. Or a character 'q' to quit the game.\n","2. Entered position cannot be the position of empty leaf.\n","3. If the selected frog position cannot perform the contraints given in rule 2 then the move is invalid.\n","\n","### Step4:-\n","Make the appropriate move by changing the game display."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-viYJbAFQXcJ"},"source":["## Step 1\n","First create a list `positions` which contains the characters 'G','B' and '-' in the same sequence as given in the initial display state."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1702817102647,"user":{"displayName":"Sahithi Reddy","userId":"13432528240755940114"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"fSvLBrjwP0sr","outputId":"fe49f7ad-a4dc-4e27-a654-a6b31c4781c3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']\n"]}],"source":["positions = ['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']\n","print(positions)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"unr1AJLSQj_4"},"source":["Now print this string ```[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]``` and after that print the list `positions`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16,"status":"ok","timestamp":1702817110449,"user":{"displayName":"Sahithi Reddy","userId":"13432528240755940114"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"qqKLcfEmQgiZ","outputId":"e6c42ddc-d8a8-4f3b-b44f-4c904070604f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]\n","['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']\n"]}],"source":["print(\"[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]\")\n","print(positions)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DuEVsgtjQqXV"},"source":["Take position input from user and write a message as `\"Press q to quit else \\nEnter position of piece:\"`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6492,"status":"ok","timestamp":1702817124318,"user":{"displayName":"Sahithi Reddy","userId":"13432528240755940114"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"nPz65EKXQnDR","outputId":"16a851ab-a75c-4140-b597-a26234f270c9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Press q to quit \n"," Enter position of piece: 3\n"]}],"source":["pos = input(\"Press q to quit \\n Enter position of piece: \")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ejy_x_eTRJmT"},"source":["Now the taken input is in string format.
